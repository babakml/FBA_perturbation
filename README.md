# FBA_perturbation
contact: babak.loghmani@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de

a toolbox to perturb FBA flux distribution in constraint-based metabolic networks

This toolbox is designed to discover the uncertainties in FBA flux distribution by perturbing the system using random values.
The toolbox is developed for [MATLAB](mathworks.com) and uses the [cobratoolbox](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/) to collect flux distribution profiles.

## Requirements

 * Make sure you have cobratoolbox installed.
 * To obtain flux distribution profiles using the `fastFVA` function, [IBM\_CPLEX](IBM.com) must be installed. The cobra toolbox works only for cplex versions up to 12.8. 
 * To obtain flux distribution profiles using `optimizeCbModel`, either IBM\_CPLEX or glpk can be used.

## Usage
To perform the perturbations use: 
 
 	[fbasol_fin, randval_fin] = perturb(model_n, solver_n) #enter model and solver name as strings
 
To perform statistical analysis:

	table = stat(model_n, per_result, print)

So for example: 

	[fbasol_fin, randval_fin] = perturb('mut-ms.xml' , 'ibm_cplex')

this will take quite a long time to run and produce files:

* `per_result*` files the file containing significantly different flux values in a sorted format

Then to calculate the statistics for this model you'd run:

	table = stat('mut-ms.xml', 'per_result', 'print')

Which would produce a result like:

	table =

  	2Ã—23 table
